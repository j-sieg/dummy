Description:
    This generator will generate the code and tests for the resource you want
    to authenticate with.

    This is inspired by Elixir Phoenix's gen_auth.

    Provides the following features:
    - Registration System
    - Session Authentication (log in and log out with database-backed tokens)
    - Email Confirmation
    - Email Changing
    - Forgot your password?
    - Reset your password

Example:
    bin/rails generate gen_auth Provider

    This will create:
        Models, views, controllers, mailers, migrations, tests, and fixtures!

    This will inject:
        - New routes for the resource in config/routes.rb
        - Monkey-patched methods in test/test_helper.rb
